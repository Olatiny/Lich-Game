  relicLore: "You find a VR headset with the words \u201CHelm of Dreams\u201D written
    on it. You find a tattered piece of newspaper stuck between some of the straps
    that reads:  \tMISSING BOY \tSeptember 17, 2003 \tThe small town of Pinecone
    was warped with worry this past weekend when one of the resident\u2019s children
    mysteriously vanished from his home. The boy\u2019s name is Edwin Francis, age
    7. His parents are frantic with fear that they will never see their child ever
    again. According to his parents, Edwin was in his room after getting ready for
    bed but wasn\u2019t there in the morning. His mother, Mrs. Francis, said \u201CWe
    [Mr. and Mrs. Francis] made sure all of the doors were locked as usual. He isn\u2019t
    the type to get up in the night, much less leave the house when it\u2019s dark
    out.\u201D A search party has formed and has looked for Edwin all through the
    West Forest last night. Tonight, they will look in the Cedar Forest after finishing
    canvasing the fields surrounding the West Forest. If you want to join the search
    party a check-in tent is located outside of town hall. The sheriff said \u201CEveryone
    is working hard to bring Edwin home. If you see any suspicious activity or gain
    any information about Edwin Francis\u2019 whereabouts, alert law enforcement
    immediately. Make sure you keep yourselves safe, do not stay out after dark and
    lock all doors and windows to your home. Parents, make sure you know where your
    kids are and what they are doing. Everyone look out for each other during these
    trying times.\u201D  "
